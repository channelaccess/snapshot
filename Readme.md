# Installation

Snapshot is available as an Anaconda package on the paulscherrerinstitute Anaconda package channel. It can be easily installed as follows:

```bash
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/paulscherrerinstitute snapshot
```

# Usage
To define a set of PVs which should be saved/restored the _snapshot_ tool requires a "request" file. Request files are in the following format. Beside accepting explicit channels also the use of macros are possible.

```
examplePv:test-1
examplePv:test-2
$(SYS):test-3
```

After snapshot is build and deployed as conda package (see section [Instalation](#installation) it can be started with following command:

```bash
snapshot [-h] [-macro MACRO] [-dir DIR] [--force] [REQUEST_FILE]

positional arguments:
  REQUEST_FILE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -macro MACRO, -m MACRO
                        Macros for request file e.g.: "SYS=TEST,DEV=D1"
  -dir DIR, -d DIR      Directory for saved files
  -base BASE, -b BASE   Base directory for opening request files
  --force, -f           Forces save/restore in case of disconnected PVs

```


## Format of saved files
When PVs values are saved using a GUI, they are stored in file where first line starts with `#` and is followed by meta data (json formating). This is followed by lines with PV names and saved data (one line per PV). Example:

```
#{"keywords": "key1,key2", "comment": "This is comment", "save_time": 1452670573.6637778}
examplePv:test-1,20
examplePv:test-2,30
examplePv:test-3,"string"
examplePv:test-4,[5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
```
